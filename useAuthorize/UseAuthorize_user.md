## 1. Introduction

The `AuthorizationProvider` component is a powerful tool for managing user authentication and authorization within a React application. It provides the necessary context and hooks to handle authorization state changes and access user-related data.

## 2. Features

The `AuthorizationProvider` component offers the following features:

-   Seamless integration with React applications
-   Automatic handling of user authorization state
-   Retrieval and storage of user information
-   Customizable login and loading components
-   Simple access to authorization-related functions and user data through hooks

## 3. Getting Started

### Installation

To use the `AuthorizationProvider` component, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install axios
    ```
2. Copy the `AuthorizationProvider` component code into a file within your project.

### Basic Usage

The `AuthorizationProvider` component should be placed at the root of your React component tree. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import AuthorizationProvider from './AuthorizationProvider';

function App() {
    return (
        <AuthorizationProvider>
            {/* Your application components */}
        </AuthorizationProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## 4. Context and Hooks

The `AuthorizationProvider` component exposes a context that provides access to authorization-related functions and data through custom hooks.

### `useAuthorize` Hook

The `useAuthorize` hook allows you to access the `authorize` function, which is used to handle authorization state changes. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useAuthorize } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const authorize = useAuthorize();

  // Call the authorize function with appropriate parameters
  authorize(true); // Example: Authorize the user

  return (
    // Your component JSX
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### `useUser` Hook

The `useUser` hook provides access to the `user` object, which contains user-related data obtained from the server. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function Profile() {
    const user = useUser();

    // Access user properties
    const { name, email } = user;

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <p>{email}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Profile;
```

### `useSetUser` Hook

The `useSetUser` hook allows you to update the user object stored in the `AuthorizationProvider` context. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useSetUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const setUser = useSetUser();

  // Update the user object
  const handleUpdateUser = () => {
    const updatedUser = { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
    setUser(updatedUser);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Call the handleUpdateUser function */}
      <button onClick={handle

UpdateUser}>Update User</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## 5. Example Usage

Here's an example of how to utilize the `AuthorizationProvider` component and its associated hooks within your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useAuthorize, useUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function Profile() {
    const authorize = useAuthorize();
    const user = useUser();

    // Perform actions based on authorization state and access user data

    return <div>{/* Display user profile */}</div>;
}

export default Profile;
```
