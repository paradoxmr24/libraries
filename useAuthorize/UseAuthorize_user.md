## 1. Introduction

## Introduction to useAuthorize

`useAuthorize` is a powerful React hook that simplifies the process of implementing authorization in your React applications. Authorization plays a crucial role in securing your application's resources and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific functionalities or view sensitive information. With `useAuthorize`, you can easily integrate and manage authorization logic within your components, making your application more secure and user-friendly.

## 2. Features

The `AuthorizationProvider` component offers the following features:

`useAuthorize` provides a range of powerful features that enhance the authorization capabilities of your React applications. Let's explore each feature in detail:

-   **Seamless Integration with React Applications**: `useAuthorize` is designed to seamlessly integrate with your React applications. Whether you are using functional components or class components, you can easily incorporate the hook into your project without disrupting your existing codebase. It works well with popular state management libraries like Redux or React Context, ensuring smooth integration with your preferred application architecture.

-   **Automatic Handling of User Authorization State**: With `useAuthorize`, managing the user authorization state becomes effortless. The hook automatically handles the tracking and updating of the user's authorization status, allowing you to easily determine whether a user is authorized to perform certain actions or access specific parts of your application. This eliminates the need for manual state management, reducing the potential for errors and making your code more maintainable.

-   **Retrieval and Storage of User Information**: `useAuthorize` provides convenient functions to retrieve and store user information. You can easily access user-specific data, such as user ID, username, email, or role, to customize the behavior of your application based on the user's attributes. This allows for personalized experiences and tailored authorization logic tailored to different user roles or permissions.

-   **Customizable Login and Loading Components**: The hook offers flexibility in customizing the login and loading components for your application. You can define your own login form or loading spinner and easily integrate them with `useAuthorize`. This allows you to create a seamless user experience during authentication and authorization processes, aligning with your application's design and branding.

-   **Simple Access to Authorization-Related Functions and User Data through Hooks**: `useAuthorize` provides convenient hooks that grant you easy access to various authorization-related functions and user data. These hooks allow you to perform actions such as checking permissions, validating user roles, or managing authentication tokens. By leveraging these hooks, you can streamline your authorization logic and make it more readable and maintainable.

## 3. Getting Started

### Installation

To use the `AuthorizationProvider` component, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install axios
    ```
2. Copy the `AuthorizationProvider` component code into a file within your project.

### Basic Usage

The `AuthorizationProvider` component should be placed at the root of your React component tree. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import AuthorizationProvider from './AuthorizationProvider';

function App() {
    return (
        <AuthorizationProvider>
            {/* Your secured application components */}
        </AuthorizationProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

All the components inside the `AuthorizationProvider` will be automatically rendered after the authorization.

## 4. Context and Hooks

The `AuthorizationProvider` component exposes a context that provides access to authorization-related functions and data through custom hooks.

### `useAuthorize` Hook

The `useAuthorize` hook allows you to access the `authorize` function, which is used to handle authorization state changes. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useAuthorize } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const authorize = useAuthorize();

  // Call the authorize function with appropriate parameters
  authorize(true); // Example: Authorize the user

  return (
    // Your component JSX
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### `useUser` Hook

The `useUser` hook provides access to the `user` object, which contains user-related data obtained from the server. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function Profile() {
    const user = useUser();

    // Access user properties
    const { name, email } = user;

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{name}</h2>
            <p>{email}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Profile;
```

### `useSetUser` Hook

The `useSetUser` hook allows you to update the user object stored in the `AuthorizationProvider` context. Here's an example of how to use it within a component:

```javascript
import { useSetUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const setUser = useSetUser();

  // Update the user object
  const handleUpdateUser = () => {
    const updatedUser = { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
    setUser(updatedUser);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Call the handleUpdateUser function */}
      <button onClick={handle

UpdateUser}>Update User</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## 5. Example Usage

Here's an example of how to utilize the `AuthorizationProvider` component and its associated hooks within your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useAuthorize, useUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function Profile() {
    const authorize = useAuthorize();
    const user = useUser();

    // Perform actions based on authorization state and access user data

    return <div>{/* Display user profile */}</div>;
}

export default Profile;
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the `AuthorizationProvider` component, please check the following:

-   Verify that the `AuthorizationProvider` is placed at the root of your component tree.
-   Ensure that the required dependencies (axios) are correctly installed.
-   Check for any error messages in the console and debug accordingly.
