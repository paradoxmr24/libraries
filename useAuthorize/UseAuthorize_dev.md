**AuthorizationProvider Developer Documentation**

The `AuthorizationProvider` component is a React component that provides authorization capabilities for managing user authentication and authorization in a React application. It uses the context API to share authorization-related data and functions with other components.

## Installation

To use the `AuthorizationProvider` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install axios
    ```

2. Copy the `AuthorizationProvider` component code into a file in your project, e.g., `AuthorizationProvider.js`.

3. Import the `AuthorizationProvider` component into the file where you want to use it:

    ```javascript
    import AuthorizationProvider from './AuthorizationProvider';
    ```

## Usage

The `AuthorizationProvider` component should be placed at the root of your component tree to enable global authorization functionality throughout your application.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import AuthorizationProvider from './AuthorizationProvider';

function App() {
    return (
        <AuthorizationProvider>
            {/* Your application components */}
        </AuthorizationProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Context

The `AuthorizationProvider` component creates a context called `authorizeContext`. This context provides the following values to its descendants:

-   `authorize`: A function used to handle authorization state changes. It takes two parameters: `loggedIn` (a boolean indicating whether the user is logged in) and `cb` (an optional callback function that receives the `setUser` function).

-   `user`: The current user object retrieved from the server. It contains user-related data.

-   `setUser`: A function used to update the user object. It takes a single parameter representing the updated user object.

## Custom Hooks

The `AuthorizationProvider` component also exports three custom hooks that can be used within other components:

-   `useAuthorize`: A hook that returns the `authorize` function from the `authorizeContext`.

-   `useUser`: A hook that returns the `user` object from the `authorizeContext`.

-   `useSetUser`: A hook that returns the `setUser` function from the `authorizeContext`.

These hooks allow you to access the authorization-related data and functions within your components. You can import them as follows:

```javascript
import { useAuthorize, useUser, useSetUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';
```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `AuthorizationProvider` component and its associated hooks within a child component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useAuthorize, useUser } from './AuthorizationProvider';

function Profile() {
    const authorize = useAuthorize();
    const user = useUser();

    // Perform authorization-related actions
    // Access the user object and modify authorization state

    return <div>{/* Display user profile */}</div>;
}

export default Profile;
```

In the example above, the `Profile` component uses the `useAuthorize` and `useUser` hooks to access the authorization-related data and functions provided by the `AuthorizationProvider`. It can perform actions based on the user's authorization state and display the user's profile information.
