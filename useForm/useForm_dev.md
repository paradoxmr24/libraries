# 1. Introduction

The useForm Hook is a powerful tool designed for handling forms in ReactJS applications. It provides developers with a set of functions and components that simplify form management and enhance the user experience. This hook is specifically built to handle various aspects of form handling, including implementing loading states, disabling the form and submit button, applying validation rules, and more.

Forms are an essential part of many web applications, and managing their state and behavior can often be complex and time-consuming. The useForm Hook aims to alleviate these challenges by abstracting away the complexities of form handling, allowing developers to focus on the core logic and functionality of their forms.

With the useForm Hook, developers can easily integrate form handling capabilities into their React components. It provides a clean and intuitive API that simplifies the process of managing form data, validating inputs, and controlling the form's behavior during submission. By leveraging the useForm Hook, developers can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code and repetitive tasks typically associated with form handling.

Key features and benefits of the useForm Hook include:

-   **Simplified Form State Management**: The useForm Hook manages the state of form inputs, values, errors, and other related attributes, making it easy to track and update form data.

-   **Loading State Handling**: The Hook provides built-in functionality to handle loading states during form submission. This ensures a smooth user experience by visually indicating that the form is being processed.

-   **Validation Rule Application**: Developers can define validation rules for form inputs, such as required fields, minimum and maximum lengths, custom validation functions, and more. The useForm Hook automatically validates input values based on these rules and provides error messages for invalid inputs.

-   **Flexible Form Configuration**: The Hook allows developers to configure various aspects of form behavior, such as retaining form values after submission, setting custom submit handlers, defining form submission methods (e.g., POST, GET), and specifying the encoding type (e.g., multipart/form-data).

By leveraging the useForm Hook, developers can expedite the development process and ensure robust and user-friendly form handling in their ReactJS applications.

## 2. Installation

To use the Library Name in your React project, follow these steps:

1. Install the library using your preferred package manager:

```
npm install useForm-lib
```

2. Import the necessary components and utilities into your React components:

```
import { Form, Submit, useForm } from 'useForm';
import { Input } from 'useForm/inputs';
```

3. Start utilizing the library's features and components in your application.

## 3. Usage

The Library Name provides various components, hooks, and utilities to facilitate form handling. The primary components include `DefaultInput` and `CircularProgress`, while the core hook is `useForm`. Additionally, there are utility functions such as `convertToMultipart`, `encodeData`, and `functions` to support form processing.

## 4. Components

### 4.1 DefaultInput

The `DefaultInput` component is a reusable input field component with default styling. It provides a consistent look and feel for text inputs in forms. You can customize its appearance and behavior as needed.

#### Example Usage:

```jsx
import { DefaultInput } from 'library-name';

const MyForm = () => {
    return (
        <form>
            <DefaultInput name='username' placeholder='Enter your username' />
            {/* Add more input fields */}
        </form>
    );
};
```

### 4.2 CircularProgress

The `CircularProgress` component displays a circular loading indicator. It can be used to indicate loading or processing states in your forms or other components.

#### Example Usage:

```jsx
import { CircularProgress } from 'library-name';

const MyForm = ({ isLoading }) => {
    return (
        <form>
            {/* Form fields */}
            {isLoading && <CircularProgress />}
            {/* Other components */}
        </form>
    );
};
```

## 5. useForm Hook

The `useForm` hook provides a convenient way to handle form state, input validation, and form submission. It returns an object containing values, error messages, event handlers, and other useful methods for managing form data.

#### Example Usage:

```jsx
import { useForm } from 'library-name';

const MyForm = () => {
    const { values, onChangeHandler, errors, reset } = useForm({
        /* form fields */
    });

    const handleSubmit = e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // Perform form submission logic
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type='text'
                name='username'
                value={values.username}
                onChange={onChangeHandler}
            />
            {/* Display error messages */}
            {errors.username && <span>{errors.username}</span>}
            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

## 6. Utilities

The Library Name provides several utility functions to support form handling and processing.

### 6.1 convertToMultipart

The `convertToM

ultipart`utility function converts form data values into a`multipart/form-data` format. It is useful for handling file uploads and other multipart requests.

### 6.2 encodeData

The `encodeData` utility function is used to encode form data based on the specified encoding type. It supports the `multipart/form-data` encoding by utilizing the `convertToMultipart` function.

### 6.3 functions

The `functions` module exports various utility functions such as `isUndefined`, `isDefined`, `convertToArray`, `getType`, and `validateType`. These functions assist in type checking and validation operations.

## 7. Inputs

The Library Name includes the `Input` component, which serves as a basic input field wrapper. It provides a consistent interface for different types of input fields, such as text, number, email, etc. You can use this component directly or as a building block for creating custom input components.

## 8. Examples

The library's documentation repository includes example code snippets and demo projects to help you understand the usage of different components and features. Please refer to the examples provided to see the library in action.

## 9. Conclusion

The Library Name simplifies form handling in React applications by providing reusable components, hooks, and utilities. It promotes efficient development practices and reduces the boilerplate code associated with form management. We hope this documentation helps you integrate and utilize the library effectively.
